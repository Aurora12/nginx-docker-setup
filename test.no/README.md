# test.no

A setup with port 443 proxying to two local servers running on 8080 (frontend) and 8065 (backend).

Port 80 is redirected to 443.

This setup uses `test.no` as a domain for TLS. The certificates included were generated by [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

This setup is supposed to be used by pointing `test.no` to `127.0.0.1` in the `hosts` file.
